<p>Recipe for the CAKEEE!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off with back edge of knife</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>12 tablespoons (1½ sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1½ cups granulated sugar</li>
    <li>6 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
    <li>¾ cup whole milk, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon almond extract</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li> 
    <li>Grease three 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.</li>
    <li>Make the cake: Whisk the cake flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Beat in the 3 eggs, 2 egg whites, and vanilla extract on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. (Mixture will look curdled as a result of the egg liquid and solid butter combining.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients just until combined. With the mixer still running on low, pour in the buttermilk and mix just until combined. You may need to whisk it all by hand to make sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick.</li>
    <li>Pour batter evenly into cake pans. Weigh them to ensure accuracy, if desired. Bake for around 23-26 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it’s done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.</li>
